# SmartHomeProject
this project intended to simulate a smart home enviroment using 2 AVRs, LCD, keypad,  some LEDs, and a temperature sensor
## Overview
We Control 4 rooms, TV, and air conditioning (AC) it has 2 modes -each are password protected- admin mode and guest mode
Admin has more privilege which he can control TV and AC but guest can control the rooms only.
If you enter password wrong multiple time you enter a block mode where you must wait a few seconds then try again, this state is saved in the non-volatile memory (EEPROM) so restarting the system will not allow you to bypass this step.
The user can set the temperature of the air conditioner which switches on and off according to comparing target and ambient temperatures using a temp sensor.
All states of rooms and air condititoning are saved in EEPROM so after restart every room state will stay same
