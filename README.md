# SmartHomeProject
Control 4 rooms, TV and air conditioning it has admin mode and guest mode and if you enter password wrong multiple time you enter block mode and you can try again after a while
if you reboot while in block mode you will still be in block mode you must wait the time to proceed 
in air conditioning control you can set the temperature and we compare it with ambient temp using temp sensor so we can turn on or off air conditioning
all states of rooms and air condititoning are saved in EEPROM so after reboot every room state will stay same
